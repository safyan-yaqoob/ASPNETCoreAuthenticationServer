# ASP.NET Core Identity Service with OpenIddict

This repository contains the code for implementing a standalone identity service using ASP.NET Core and OpenIddict. The identity service is designed to provide authorization and authentication capabilities for other applications through the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols.

## Key Features

- OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 Support
- Token Management
- Security Features
- Integration with External Identity Providers
- Authorization Flows

## Authorization Code Flow

The Authorization Code Flow is recommended for new applications. It involves several steps, including initiating the authentication process, validating cookies, user authentication, and token exchange.

## Scopes

Scopes define the specific permissions or access levels requested by client applications during the authorization process. Common scopes include openid, profile, email, address, phone, and offline_access.

## Getting Started

To set up the project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Configure PostgreSQL as the database.
3. Install the required OpenIddict packages using NuGet.
4. Configure OpenIddict in your ASP.NET Core application.

## Code Structure

- **Authentication Endpoint**: Implementation of the "/authorize" endpoint.
- **Token Endpoint**: Implementation of the "/token" endpoint.
- **Logout Endpoint**: Implementation of the logout functionality.
- **Login With External Identity Provider**: Configuration for external identity providers.
- **Callback Endpoint**: Implementation of the callback endpoint for external authentication.
